There are data associated with 2 sets of runs. We recommend run _2 for the paper. 

_1: first case, where we DID NOT exactly match hub-height plane-averaged wind speed and direction, but got pretty close
_2: second case, where we DID match hub-height plane-averaged wind speed and direction

This folder contains old wake metrics from case _1.
